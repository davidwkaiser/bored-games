# bored-games

'Bored? Games!' is a web application that allows users to search through a database of board games using varying criteria. Users can also save games to their libraries, add other users as friends, give their favorite games 'points' to give them a positive rating, and view their friends' libraries of games.

The application is a Ruby on Rails program that that is hosted on [Heroku](https://bored-games-arch.herokuapp.com/ "Heroku") and uses a PostgreSQL database that was populated using Nokogiri and the [board game geek API](http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2 "Board Game Geek API").

# About me
I am a graduate of Dev Bootcamp, I'm looking for my first dev job. I know Ruby / Rails, JavaScript / jQuery / AJAX,   
HTML / CSS, and SQL. I've used Ionic (Angular for mobile), but don't remember much about it. I'm teaching myself  
Node.JS and Angular 2. I recently attended Angular Summit 2017 and an Angular workshop / MeetUp, I'm serious about  
learning Angular 2.  
  
I'm a leader, I'm responsible, and I'm low drama.  

I'm looking for an internship to start August 1 2017. See details at www.linkedin.com/pulse/announcing-daves-roll-your-own-apprenticeship-david-kaiser
